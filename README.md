# Human_Excreta_System
The system consists of a chemosensor that is placed near the residentâ€™s bed or area of stay, that is later activated when the chemosensor detects the smell of urine and/or feces. Once the sensor is activated, it is programmed to send an alert to the computer and/or mobile application that the resident has soiled their briefs, or has eliminated waste (urine and/or feces) nearby in their area of stay.  The purpose of this system is to prevent those who wear diapers and are dependents from getting urinary tract infections (UTIs), maintaining hygiene, preventing from odor, lessening skin irritation, and preventing from bacteria growth.
